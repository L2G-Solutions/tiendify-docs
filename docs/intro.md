# Introduction

On this page you will learn how to integrate your Tiendify API into your custom shop website.

## The basics

The first thing you should know is that the API you will be comunicating with is a dedicated server for your shop.

**Advantages of dedicated API server:**

- Secured and isolated data from other Tiendify customers
- You have dedicated, _physical_ resources only to serve your shop. This ensures high availability, reliance and avoids resource-racing.

Some of your store's data (such as public products) can be accessed publicly without any authentication like API keys or Public Key. This means the integration is as straightforward as starting to call the API endpoints.
